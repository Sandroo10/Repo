        <p>Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor. He is the founder, chairman, CEO, and 
            chief technology officer of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO and product architect of <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target=".blank">Tesla</a>, Inc.; owner and 
            CTO of Twitter; founder of the Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; and president of the Musk Foundation. 
            Musk is the wealthiest person in the world 
            with an estimated net worth of US$239 billion as of July 2023, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and $248.8 billion

        <p>In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars. In October of the same year, he 
            traveled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and the group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia with Mike Griffin (president of In-Q-Tel) to look for three ICBMs. 
            They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.
             With $100 million of his own money, Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.</p>

            <p>Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017 and had previously questioned 
                the platform's commitment to freedom of speech. In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter 
                shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April, making him the largest shareholder. When this was publicly disclosed, 
                witter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 IPO. On April 4, Musk agreed 
                to a deal that
                 would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.</p>
